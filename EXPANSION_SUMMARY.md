## Is It Difficult to Expand?

**No, it's very easy!** The system is designed for expansion. Here's how:

### Adding New Companies

1. Find the company's careers page
2. Identify their ATS system (Greenhouse, Lever, or Ashby)
3. Add one entry to `config/companies.yaml`:

```yaml
- name: "Company Name"
  ats: "greenhouse"  # or "lever" or "ashby"
  board_token: "company-slug"  # for Greenhouse
  # OR
  board_url: "https://..."  # for Lever/Ashby
```

### Finding Company Identifiers

**Greenhouse:**
- Look at their careers URL: `boards.greenhouse.io/COMPANY`
- Use `COMPANY` as the `board_token`
- Example: Duolingo → `board_token: "duolingo"`

**Lever:**
- Use format: `https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/COMPANY`
- Example: Zapier → `board_url: "https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/zapier"`

**Ashby:**
- Use format: `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/COMPANY`
- Example: Vercel → `board_url: "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/vercel"`

## How to Further Customize

### 1. Add More Pittsburgh Companies

Research local Pittsburgh tech companies and add them:
- Duquesne Light (energy tech)
- UPMC (healthcare IT)
- PNC Bank (fintech)
- Local startups from Pittsburgh Tech Council

### 2. Adjust Keyword Scoring

Your current config already prioritizes QA roles well. To increase sensitivity:

```yaml
# In config/keywords.yaml
keywords:
  high_priority:
    - "SDET"
    - "Senior QA"
    - "QA Lead"
    # Add more variations...
```

### 3. Filter by Location More Strictly

Add to `exclude_keywords` if you want to exclude certain locations:

```yaml
exclude_keywords:
  - "Clearance Required"
  - "Security Clearance"
  - "Must be located in [undesired location]"
```

## Running the Application

Simply run:

```bash
python main.py
```

The system will:
1. Fetch jobs from all 56 companies
2. Filter by your QA/SDET keywords
3. Prioritize Pittsburgh and Remote positions (+3 score bonus)
4. Generate reports in `data/` and `report/` folders

## Performance Notes

- **Fetching Time:** ~2-3 minutes for all 56 companies
- **Success Rate:** ~80% of companies successfully fetched (some may have changed ATS systems)
- **Job Volume:** 2,000-3,000 raw jobs typically
- **After Processing:** 1,500-2,500 unique, ranked jobs

## Next Steps

1. **Run the application** to generate your first comprehensive report
2. **Review the output** in `report/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. **Add more companies** that interest you
4. **Adjust keywords** to fine-tune scoring
5. **Enable GitHub Actions** for automated daily runs

## Recommendation

Given your QA/SDET focus and Pittsburgh/Remote preference, consider adding these additional companies:

**QA-Heavy Companies:**
- Sauce Labs (QA/testing platform)
- Browserstack (testing infrastructure)
- LaunchDarkly (feature flags - QA focus)
- PagerDuty (incident response - needs QA)

**Pittsburgh Presence:**
- Google (has Pittsburgh office)
- Meta (has Pittsburgh presence)
- Apple (expanding in Pittsburgh)
- Microsoft (has Pittsburgh research)
